# CNN-Milestone-projects
First CNN projects done after learning about them.

__#1 Cifar10 Classification:__
A CNN that studies the Cifar10 dataset and classifies the images into its respective 10 categories with around 80% accuracy. <br>
__#2 Cifar10 AutoEncoder:__ 
A CNN that encodes the images in the Cifar10 dataset with minimal loss in legibility. <br>
__#3 FMNIST:__ 
A CNN that studies the Fashion MNIST dataset and classifies the images into the 10 categories of fashion items available with 90% accuracy. <br>
__#4 Psychometric Functions:__
A CNN that studies generated horizontal/vertical lines on gaussian noise than classifies lines generated with a slope of -30 to 30 into the categories of horizontal / vertical. <br>
__#4 Style Transfer VGG19__
Using the pretrained Vgg19 model to display style transfer from a Vincent Van Gogh painting to the picture of Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.
